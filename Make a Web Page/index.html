				The user sends the data to the Internet and makes contact with a server via HTML. The server sends back the appropriate HTML to the user where the browser decodes the information and projects it to the screen.

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				Stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, which is basically based on <em>text</em> (what you see) and  <em>Markup</em> (how it looks). HTML classifies page content, tells a browser what's text and image and so on. HTML controls structure by following certain syntax and rules.

				It means that computers have a specific language and understanding for things which sometimes makes it frustrating for programmers commit silly mistakes could make it more difficult to program an application.

				HTML is made of <b>elements</b> which help to give plain text more texture and structure with the help of <b>tags</b>, which consist of a wide variety of choices from making text <b>bold</b>, <em>italic</em>, or refer to a website like <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>. We can &lt;br&gt;eak long lines and create more structure by tagging &lt;p&gt;aragraphs and &lt;h&gt;eadlines. Some elements are invisible, but the visible elements form rectangular boxes.

		</div>
		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				<em>Inline</em> is mostly for elements that work within a line like "break," "bold," and "italic." <em>Block</em> are mostly within several lines like "paragraph" and "division" where they form an <em>invisible box</em> around their content.

				<p>Don't Memorize Everything!</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				There are a lot of references on the web that programmers could use to write code instead of trying to memorize every single element and attribute. It is important for a programmer to familiarize him/herself with those references and resources so he/she could be more effective and fluent writing code.

		</div>
		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">Wikipedia</a>, a <b>tree structure</b> is "a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form." HTML includes a lot of elements inside other elements which create relationships between them. Defining those relations will help to build a structure that will bring order to HTML coding.

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				Elements are contained within boxes and because elements could exist withing each other, there could be two or more boxes inside each box. It's important to keep track of their attributes so there won't be any unnecessary overlapping and conflict.

		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				Programmers use tools to write code which are called <b>text editors</b>. There are many different text editors like <em>Sublime Text</em> and <em>Scratchpad</em> which make programmer's life a lot easier. They specially help with elements and tags where programmer wouldn't have to worry memorizing or writing the whole tag, the text editor will view suggestions and even complete the tag with one click.

		</div>
		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				There are a lot of similar lines within an HTML code and copy/pasting those lines helps a programmer to save some time, but it may cause a lot of mistakes. It's important to define and structure those lines so it wouldn't create unwanted repetitions. By creating <b><em>class</em></b> and <b><em>div</em></b> within a code could help avoiding those mistakes and repetitions.

		</div>	
		<div class="concept-description">
			<p>
				CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it basically gives a programmer to control the style of an HTML element. An important part of CSS is <b>"Inheritance"</b> which is part of an ancestor-descendant relationship. By using <b>class</b> in a code we are taking advantage of the inheritance property in an HTML. It helps to style a class and its descendants rather than styling it line by line.
